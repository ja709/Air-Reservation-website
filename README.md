[Let's go to AirSite](http://ec2-3-15-158-105.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/Airsite/)

## Getting Started

The basic idea of online travel reservation system is that it allows customers to use the web to browse/search the contents of your database and to make flight reservations over the web. Your web site should allow users to make both domestic  and  international  reservations.  It  should  also  allow  users  to  query  the  database  for available  flights  (direct  or  indirect)  between  a  pair  of  cities  for  a  given  date  and  "approximate" time.
